Do you host inhouses for your community and keep track of statistics from the game? 
Are you tired of spending hours a week typing in everything manually?
I created a Google Spreadsheet that uses the Riot API to do all the hard work for you!
This product is designed for League of Legends communities the frequently host inhouses (aka 5v5 customs). 

Instead of meticulously typing in each stat in by hand and spending hours on statistics, this product uses the match API to quickly and accurately pull all available data points from a custom game into a secure Google Spreadsheet. 

The data in the spreadsheet is neatly organized and ordered by tabs so anyone including players and admin can view their performance and progress as they continue to play within the community.

The products brings the community together by encouraging individuals regardless of their Rank to create positive personal connections through meeting others from games and allows individuals to enjoy the game both casually and or competitively as the product keeps track of player's local Elo that is reset at the beginning of every month.
